## Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- We will assess severity and provide a remediation timeline.
- Critical vulnerabilities will be patched immediately.
- Credit will be given to reporters unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope

Security reports should relate to:

- Cryptographic misuse
- Canonicalization flaws
- Signature validation errors
- Identity spoofing vulnerabilities
- Bundle verification bypasses
- Replay attack weaknesses

Reports about ecosystem misuse (malicious but correctly signed skills) are out of scope for ASI v0.1, as ASI verifies identity, not intent.
